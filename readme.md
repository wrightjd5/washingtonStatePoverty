## Data Conversion Process

A shapefile representing counties in Washington State was found on [IGISMap](https://www.igismap.com/download-washington-state-gis-maps-boundary-counties-rail-highway/) and then converted to GeoJSON using [geojson.com](http://geojson.com). Data representing the number of people aged 0-17 experiencing poverty per county in Washington was found from the [U.S. Department of Agriculture - Economic Research Service](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/county-level-data-sets-download-data/) and was joined with the Washington counties GeoJSON file using [geojson.com](http://geojson.com). The point data representing the number of discount and charity stores was found as a shapefile on [IGISMap](https://www.igismap.com/download-washington-state-gis-maps-boundary-counties-rail-highway/) and was then converted to GeoJSON format using [geojson.com](http://geojson.com).
